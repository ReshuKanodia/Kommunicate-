If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you
will choose as your partner and why?

If I start a Software Company , the two people whim I will choose from my batch will be Kushagra Gupta (RA1911003030015) and Raj Rishabh Singh (RA1911003030018).
These are two people whom I found very optimistic and open to learn anything.
